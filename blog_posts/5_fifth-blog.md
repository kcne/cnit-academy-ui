ES6 brought major improvements to JavaScript. Some highlights include:

- `let` and `const` for better variable scoping
- Arrow functions (`=>`)
- Template literals for cleaner strings
- Destructuring objects and arrays
- Default parameters and spread/rest operators

Learning ES6 is a must for writing modern, clean JavaScript.

`let` is block-scoped; `const` is for constants:

```js
let age = 30;
const PI = 3.14;
```
