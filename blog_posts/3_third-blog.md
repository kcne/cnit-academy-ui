JavaScript arrays come with powerful built-in methods. Some of the most useful include:

- `map()`: transforms each element
- `filter()`: removes unwanted items
- `reduce()`: accumulates a value from all items
- `forEach()`: iterates over each item

These methods help you write cleaner and more functional code.

# Introduction

Arrays are powerful data structures in JavaScript, and knowing how to manipulate them is essential. Here are some must-know methods that will help you write cleaner, more efficient code.

# 1. `map()`

Transforms each element and returns a new array:

```js
let nums = [1, 2, 3];
let doubled = nums.map((n) => n * 2); // [2, 4, 6]
```
