# Introduction

JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the web, alongside HTML and CSS. It allows you to bring your websites to life with interactivity and dynamic content.

# What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a scripting language used to create and control dynamic website content. It runs in the browser, allowing developers to:

- React to user interactions
- Modify the DOM (Document Object Model)
- Send and receive data from servers
- Build complex web applications

# Including JavaScript in HTML

There are two main ways to add JavaScript to your webpage:

```html
<!-- Inline -->
<script>
  alert("Hello, world!");
</script>

<!-- External file -->
<script src="script.js"></script>
```
